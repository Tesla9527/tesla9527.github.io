>Since I have done software testing for nearly 5 years, I just want to write some summary about how to do software testing.

Test Plan

Test Scenarios

Test Cases
	There are many tools to write test cases like word, excel etc. But I hate to use word to write test cases, it's fucking bad.

A good question to be asked in an interview: What is the difference between Test Cases and Test Scenarios?
“Test Case is ‘How to be tested’ and Test Scenario is ‘What to be tested’”.

Test Management Tools
	1. TFS(I think Microsoft dones very well in testing, so if your team is using TFS, then just use it to do test management. It is really good.)
	2. JIRA
	3. HP Quality Center
