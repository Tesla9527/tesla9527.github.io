>Since I have done software testing for nearly 5 years, I just want to write some summary about how to do software testing.

Test Plan

Test Scenarios

Test Cases

Test Management Tools
	1. TFS(I think Microsoft dones very well in testing, so if your team is using TFS, then just use it to do test management. It is really good.)
	2. JIRA
	3. HP Quality Center
